# Quantum Bookstore

Quantum Bookstore is a simple Java console-based application that simulates an online bookstore with different types of books and purchasing logic.

## Features

- Add books to inventory with details: ISBN, title, author, publish year, and price
- Three types of books:
  - **PaperBook**: has stock and is shipped to an address
  - **EBook**: has a file type and is sent to an email
  - **ShowcaseBook**: visible only, not for sale
- Buy a book by providing ISBN, quantity, email, and address
  - Checks stock availability
  - Reduces stock when purchased
  - Throws an error if book is not found or out of stock
- Remove outdated books published before a certain number of years
- All console output is prefixed with **Quantum book store**

## Technologies Used

- Java (OpenJDK 23)
- IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate
- OOP design (inheritance, abstraction)

## How to Run

1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**
2. Ensure SDK is set to Java 23
3. Navigate to `Main.java`
4. Right-click and choose **Run**
5. Console output will appear showing added books, purchases, and errors
